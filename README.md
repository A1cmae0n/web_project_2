# Web Project 2
## A Practicum courseware project 

This project is a pure HTML/CSS page that implements a more design-centric UI than Projet 1. Forms are implemented, though have no functional utility. 

This project implements advaced HTML, including @keyframes animations, transitions, and different file structure that leveages @import statements.
